The easiest (we mean it!) way to capture UTMs on your (optin) forms. Supports: Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, Salesforce, ActiveCampaign and many more.

== Description ==
= WordPress UTM Tracker Plugin =

Capture and track **all the UTM** variables, gclid (and more) as soon as user hits your website (ANY page of your WP installation): One great feature of the plugin is the UTM variables are saved in **client's browser (COOKIES)** and even though there is no UTM variables in URL (query arguments/parameters), the variables can still be accessible via shortcode across any page/widget of your website. Because they are pulled from client-side user cookies.
